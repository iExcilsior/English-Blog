    <h3>Wear Masks and Faceshield</h3>
    <p>These are some of the things we’ve learned:</p>
    <article>
      <p>
        That by wearing masks, <strong>masks and face coverings can prevent the wearer from transmitting the COVID-19 virus to others and may provide some protection to the wearer. Multiple studies have shown that face coverings can contain droplets expelled from the wearer, which are responsible for the majority of transmission of the virus</strong>. This 'source control' approach reflects a shift in thinking from a 'medical' perspective (will it protect the wearer?) to a 'public health' perspective (will it help reduce community transmission and risk for everyone?).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Many people with COVID-19 are unaware they are carrying the virus</strong>. It is estimated that 40% of persons with COVID-19 are asymptomatic but potentially able to transmit the virus to others. In the absence widespread screening tests, we have no way of identifying many people who are silently transmitting the virus in their community.

    <h3>Wash your hands frequently and carefully</h3>
    <article>
      <p>
      Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists, between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap.
        <br>
        <br>
      Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day, especially after touching anything, including your phone or laptop.

  <h3>Don't Share Personal Items</h3>
  <p>Do not share personal items like</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Phones</li>
    <li>Make Up</li>
    <li>combs</li>
  </ul>
  <article>
    <p>
      It’s also important not to share eating utensils and straws. Teach children to recognize their reusable cup, straw, and other dishes for their own use only.

  <h3>Take Physical Social Distancing Seriously</h3>
  <article>
    <p>If you’re carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it’ll be found in high amounts in your spit (sputum). This can happen even if you don’t have symptoms.
      <br>
      <br>
    Physical (social) distancing, also means staying home and working remotely when possible.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you must go out for necessities, keep a distance of 6 feet (2 m) from other people. You can transmit the virus by speaking to someone in close contact to you.</p>

  <h3 class="wassup">Do not gather in groups</h3>
  <article>
    <p>
      Being in a group or gathering makes it more likely that you’ll be in close contact with someone.
      <br>
      <br>
      This includes avoiding all religious places of worship, as you may have to sit or stand too close to another congregant. It also includes not congregating at parks or beaches.
